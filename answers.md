How do the running times compare to the asymptotic bounds?
Quicksort:
O(n log n) for average or expected case
O(N^2) for worst case
Selection Sort:
O(N^2) for average case
O(N^2) for worst case
How does changing the type of input list change the relative performance of these algorithms? 
Timsort is faster than the other sorting algorithms in this lab. True for all sizes tested. With unsorted data timsort is still fastest, ssort is very slow, and fixed and random pivot are relativly the same, but not better than timsort. With sorted data timsort is still fastest, fixed pivot perfoms the worst, and ssort and random pivot ssort don't change very much. Therefore, timsort is the best.
